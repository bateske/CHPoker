// Saving options, lifetime stats and a game in progress.
//
// CHGame has no EEPROM, but its bootloader only erases the flash pages a new
// sketch occupies, so the last pages of the application region survive
// re-uploads. Two pages are used in turn, each record carrying a sequence
// number and a CRC, so a power cut mid-write can only lose the newest save.
// If the sketch ever grows into those pages, saving switches itself off
// rather than overwrite code. (From CHBlackjack, with its own magic: the two
// games share the pages, and each ignores the other's records.)
