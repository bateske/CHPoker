// Saving the purse, options and lifetime stats.
//
// CHGame has no EEPROM, but its bootloader only erases the flash pages a new
// sketch occupies, so the last pages of the application region survive
// re-uploads. Two pages are used in turn, each record carrying a sequence
// number and a CRC, so a power cut mid-write can only lose the newest save.
// If the sketch ever grows into those pages, saving switches itself off
// rather than overwrite code. (From CHBlackjack via CHChess, with its own
// magic: the CHGame games share the pages, and each ignores the others'
// records - so saving here replaces another game's save.)
